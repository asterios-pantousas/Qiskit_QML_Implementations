# Quantum Machine Learning implementations with qiskit

In this repository I'll gather all the Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Implementations using Qiskit 1.0 library.
THe purpose is to implement and undestand the QML models described in these two tutorials [1](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-machine-learning/tutorials/index.html) and [2](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/tree/main/notebooks/quantum-machine-learning#) the latter uses a later version of qiskit and should be explored with extra care.
