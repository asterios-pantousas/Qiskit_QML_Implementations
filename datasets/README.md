## ðŸ«€ Heart Failure Prediction Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)  
- **File:** `heart.csv`  
- **Description:**  
  This dataset includes medical records of patients that can be used to predict heart disease.  
  It contains **11 clinical features** (such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, maximum heart rate, etc.) along with a binary target variable:  
  - `HeartDisease = 1` â†’ patient has heart disease  
  - `HeartDisease = 0` â†’ patient does not have heart disease  

- **Columns Overview:**  
  - `Age` â€“ Age of the patient  
  - `Sex` â€“ Gender (M/F)  
  - `ChestPainType` â€“ Chest pain type (e.g., ATA, NAP, ASY)  
  - `RestingBP` â€“ Resting blood pressure  
  - `Cholesterol` â€“ Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)  
  - `FastingBS` â€“ Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)  
  - `RestingECG` â€“ Resting electrocardiogram results  
  - `MaxHR` â€“ Maximum heart rate achieved  
  - `ExerciseAngina` â€“ Exercise induced angina (Y/N)  
  - `Oldpeak` â€“ ST depression induced by exercise  
  - `ST_Slope` â€“ Slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
  - `HeartDisease` â€“ Target variable

## ðŸ§  Stroke Prediction Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Stroke Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)  
- **File:** `stroke.csv`  
- **Description:**  
  This dataset contains information about patients that can be used to predict the likelihood of a stroke.  
  The dataset includes **10 features** related to demographics, lifestyle, and health history, with a binary target variable indicating the occurrence of stroke:  
  - `stroke = 1` â†’ patient experienced a stroke  
  - `stroke = 0` â†’ patient did not experience a stroke  

- **Columns Overview:**  
  - `id` â€“ Patient ID  
  - `gender` â€“ Gender of the patient  
  - `age` â€“ Age of the patient  
  - `hypertension` â€“ 0 = no, 1 = yes  
  - `heart_disease` â€“ 0 = no, 1 = yes  
  - `ever_married` â€“ Marital status  
  - `work_type` â€“ Type of work (children, govt_job, never_worked, private, self-employed)  
  - `Residence_type` â€“ Urban or rural  
  - `avg_glucose_level` â€“ Average glucose level in blood  
  - `bmi` â€“ Body Mass Index  
  - `smoking_status` â€“ Current smoking status  
  - `stroke` â€“ Target variable

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Both datasets originate from **Kaggle** and were preprocessed to suit the prediction tasks in this thesis.
- They are intended only for **educational and research purposes**.
- Any preprocessing or feature engineering steps applied in this project are documented within the thesis and accompanying code.
